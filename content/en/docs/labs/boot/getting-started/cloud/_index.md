If you are setting up a production installation of Jenkins X we hope to have a [terraform](/docs/labs/boot/getting-started/cloud/terraform/) example for you to try soon.

Until then if you are using Google Cloud we recommend you use [gcloud](/docs/labs/boot/getting-started/cloud/gcloud/) to setup your Kubernetes cluster and the associated cloud resources
