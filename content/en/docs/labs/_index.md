We want to enable the Jenkins X open source community to move fast, innovate and iterate while at the same time keeping stability.

So we innovate within the Labs so that we can go quickly and innovate rapidly then when things are stable we can roll them into the stable Jenkins X release.

**This current experiment is now closed. The work done and feedback we have received will be used to enhance Jenkins X in future versions**

For more details see the [Labs Enhancements proposal](https://github.com/rawlingsj/enhancements/blob/master/proposals/labs/README.md)
