Whether you're new to development or have multiple existing projects, Jenkins X can help you automate your building, testing, and deployments quickly and easily!

### Quickstarts

If you're just starting your development process with Jenkins X and want to use some tested, supported project templates that you can setup quickly, you can create a **Quickstart**!

Quickstarts are pre-made applications you can create a project from, instead of making one from scratch.

### Importing

If you already have one or more existing software projects and want to use Jenkins X to manage the build, test, and release cycle, you can import your project.
