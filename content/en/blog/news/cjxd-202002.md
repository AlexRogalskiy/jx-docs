2020 is fully underway and Jenkins X is feeling the benefits from a lot of hard work from the tail end of last year.  There is now support on EKS for Jenkins X!  Here are the docs:

- https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/clouds/amazon/

They are still being improved so we'd love feedback in the [Slack channel](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack) or issues (PRs would be even better ;)) on the [website repository](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs) to help improve.  By the way a Pull Request on the docs repo results in a preview environment of the website, so you can see your changes and ask for feedback in true Jenkins X form.

EKS support includes full TLS and DNS, Vault and documented required IAM roles. 

This is largely a result of contributions from CloudBees as they work on building out CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution (CJXD).  This distro can come with support from CloudBees but is based on the upstream Jenkins X, there's no separate fork so any code that is needed to support EKS and other Jenkins X features goes into the Jenkins X codebase, for the Jenkins X community to benefit from.

As well as EKS support last month there were 161 issues and enhancements resolved so there's lots of effort to keep continually improving Jenkins X.

There will be a monthly blog that will describe the improvements that keep making Jenkins X better so please keep an eye out for these and as always let us know via slack or issues how things can be better.
